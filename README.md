# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview

Pyber is a ride-sharing company and we did an analysis on data using a large number of CSV file. This analysis will help PyBer to improve the ride-sharing app.
Using Python and pandas we will creat a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. we will creat a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for  each city type. we will summarize how the data differs by cirty type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
